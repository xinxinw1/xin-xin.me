  h2 Piano Performances
  
  p I took piano lessons from Ruta Vaivade in Oakville, Ontario (who I highly recommend if you want to become a concert pianist) and completed my Grade 10 RCM. Here are some recordings I made:
  
  +piano('Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2 by Liszt', "https://www.youtube.com/embed/Apfvr2DCzKw")
  +piano('Fugue in E-flat Major WTC 2 by Bach', "https://www.youtube.com/embed/tJLoWKCXnmA")
  +piano('Etude in E Major Op. 28, No. 3 by Chopin', "https://www.youtube.com/embed/6BvAdF7clp4")
